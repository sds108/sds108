# Hi, my name is Sebastian
You can find my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdslawski/).

### I am a Computer Engineering Student at Trinity College Dublin. 

When I'm not overloaded with college work, you can find me working on various fun projects.
Sometimes it's motorcycle restoration, other times it's jumping into random topic rabbit holes and research.
But most of the time it's something to do with math and engineering, and usually written in C++ or C.
